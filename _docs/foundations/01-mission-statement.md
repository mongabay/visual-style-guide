The advent of large, publicly available datasets containing all kinds of environmental and socio-economic information presents the media community with a powerful new opportunity to synthesize, interpret, and communicate complex environmental issues with increased relevance for a greater diversity of people. This visual style guide is intended to provide a introduction for journalists working with Mongabay to the design principles, templates, and tools used in our global newsroom to harness the illustrative potential of this data for use in storytelling that inspires the public to recognize the links between society and the environment.
