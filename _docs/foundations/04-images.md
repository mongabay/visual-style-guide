The overal feeling of the pictures shows the nature world with lots of green and warm tones giving
context to the journalism story. Choose bright and vibrant images over dark images with poor
contrast. When capturing people try to focus on their faces whenever possible, portraits or medium
shots can send a stronger message giving an humanistic warmth. When capturing animals these should
be easy to recognize in contrast with the environment.
