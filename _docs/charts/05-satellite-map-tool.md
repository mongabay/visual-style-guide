## What is the satellite map tool

The satellite map tool lets you create images of maps using a wide set of basemaps, contextual layers and data layers.

If you don't know where to start, have a look at the map presets. These are combination of layers carefully selected to provide information about a specific topics such as conservation.

By clicking on the export button, you can also find more advanced options to create side-by-side maps, with a spatial or temporal difference. If you select the spatial option, you'll be able to center each map wherever you want and both will show the exact same data for these locations. If you select the temporal difference, all the maps will show the same area, but at a different point in time. Only one layer at a time can show different time frames.

Finally, when you're happy with the visualisation, click on export again, select the size of the exported image (the ratio is fixed) and click download.

## Code

The code of the tool and the tool itself are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/mongabay/satellite-stamp). If you wish to make modifications to the tool, please read the README file of the repository.

Note there is also a [wiki](https://github.com/mongabay/satellite-stamp/wiki) where you can find information about how to modify the layers, presets and attributions.
