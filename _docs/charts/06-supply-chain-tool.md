## What is the supply chain tool

The [supply chain tool](https://chains.mongabay.com/) lets you create images of maps with flows representing the exchange of a variety of commodities across the world.

From top to bottom, use the filters of the sidebar to select an exporting country, a commodity, a change unit, a year and optionally a region and exporter.

Whenever you update a filter, the map is updated to display up to 10 flows at a time, and the ranking, up to 5. If you place your cursor on top of a flow or a country, you can also visualize the amount that is exported.

When you're happy with the result, click the export button, select the size of the exported image (the ratio is fixed) and click download.

## Code

The code of the tool and the tool itself are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/mongabay/supply-chain-chart). If you wish to make modifications to the tool, please read the README file of the repository.
